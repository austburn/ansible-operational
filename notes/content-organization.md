Variables
---------
- Host Variables are facts about a server
    - Examples
        - hostname
        - ip addresses
        - date/time info
        - cpu/disk/memory
        - hardware architecture
        - os info
    - Come from
        - inventory
        - host name
        - host_vars
- Group Variables
    - Come from:
        - inventory
        - group_vars
    - `all` is a special keyword - applied to all hosts/groups/etc
- Precedence
    - should feel _natural_
    - Most specifically applied variable wins
- Uses `mustache`-like variable expansion
group_vars/all
```yaml
---
apache2_version: 2.2.22-1ubuntu1
```
tasks
```
- apt: name="apache2={{ apache2_version }}" state=present
```
- register is a special keyword that will assign the output of a module to a variable
```
- git: repo=git://github.com/ansible/ansible.git dest=/tmp/ansible
  register: ansible_git
```
- debug module
```
- debug: var=ansible_git
# prints information about the variable
```
- dynamically add host facts
    - use the `set_fact` module
- Including Variables
    - vars_files is used in playbooks to include a file of variables outside of the usual locations
        - secrets, site specific data, etc. outside of version control
    - include_vars
        - similar to vars_files, but for roles
        - `include_vars: "../vars/{{ansible_os_family}}.yml"`
